# tech-ed-week-1-assignment
Build a SpaceY-type web site

Hi Sam, guys. I'm sorry to say I think I've failed to upload my assignment, let alone deploy it. Even if I'd managed it is woefully incomplete. This is not for lack of trying. I'm very frustrated indeed but I won't give up yet, and hopefully never. But I don't want to be a drag on the group either.

I think I need to take closer notes (which I've begun to do as of Friday).

I have a masters degree so I know I'm not daft; I need to break through.

See you, and thanks.
